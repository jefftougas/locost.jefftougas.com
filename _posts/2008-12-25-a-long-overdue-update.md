Alrighty, whew, its been quite a while since I’ve worked on this thing. You know that whole.. life thing? Yeah, that kinda got in the way I was working on this thing hardcore but then I had a TON of various crap happen (including moving twice within 4 months, getting in an accident on my motorcycle, buying another and then having that one stolen 3 weeks later..), and I’ve been really busy trying to get a few things sorted out. ANYWAYS hopefully I’m through the worst of it and I can devote a decent amount of time to this project.

  
So lets see.. Yeah I mentioned moving. I’m now living in a sweet 3-story townhome with a two car garage in the middle of downtown Atlanta with evox (see his completed car in my pics), and we have the most kickass garage setup ever. Also, this is a huge upgrade from my previous situation, which was working on the car at Mom’s garage which was a 30 minute drive away. Now my project is a 20 second trip down a flight of stairs. 
  
I have my miata completely stripped and all the parts I need for most stuff, so its really time for me to begin construction (as opposed to deconstruction). Today I drew the base frame rail on my build table, cut all the tubes, cleaned them with my drill-press/abrasive wheel combo (so they’re nice and shiny/non-greasy and ready for welding), and cut the tubes for the L-assembly. The compound angles on the L-assembly took some figuring, and I’m not yet convinced that my angles are exactly accurate, so I may end up re-cutting those tubes. That will have to wait though, as its 4:20am on christmas day 
  
Anywho, enjoy the pics. I have some of the new garage and of course of the progress I made today.
