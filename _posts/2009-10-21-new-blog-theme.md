I’m excited, and so should you be.  Tonight I decided to separate my blog into a couple different sites so as not to clutter it with unrelated topics.  Also, I’ve updated the theme and overall functionality a bit to make it much nicer to use both from my perspective as the writer and yours as the reader.  I hope to write a detailed “about” page soon, as well as begin populating the “garage” and “resources” sections.  I’ll be adding my favorite build logs to my links section as well.  Be sure to check back for updates.
