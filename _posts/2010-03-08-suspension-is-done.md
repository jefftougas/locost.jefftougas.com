The control arms and shock mounts are all fabricated finally! They’re just tac-welded at the moment but I like to leave final-welding for days when I don’t feel like doing anything that requires design/engineering.  I also got in some more parts, including the passenger seat, steering wheel, nose cone, and others that are less picture-worthy.

Tonight I started on the parking brake and discovered that the cable is wanting to go into my frame at the moment due to my rear wheels being so far forward.  I’m not sure what I’m going to do to fix this, but I have a feeling it will involve disassembling the rear brakes and fabricating a new set of e-brake brackets for the rear calipers.
