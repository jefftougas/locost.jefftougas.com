Another status update.  
  
So, I’ve got a 1.6 liter donor, but of course I’d like an LSD, so I’m borrowing a torsen right now (which I may come to own eventually). I had no idea the diff in the 1.8 liter cars was so friggin huge. I’ve been working on making the transmission tunnel, and I’m going to have to have the passenger side body work bow out or something to make room for the diff/driveshaft.

  
I cut the front bulkhead tube (the one at the back of the engine) and am going to move it back/reinforce it somehow later, but I did this so that I could move the engine back significantly. Of course, that’s moved the whole transmission back and required some careful thought on the rest of the tunnel.   
  
I also decided to take a break from the tunnel and start making my motor mounts. I love this welder (Lincoln Pro-Mig 140), it practically does all the work for me.
