		<description>How did the control arm jigs work? I&#039;m building my own snowmobile from scratch and have been wondering how to make decent jigs to get consistent parts. Is your base piece just MDF?</description>

		<description>Hi Tom, glad you like it.  As far as modifying the frame for the rear diff, you just have to make sure you have the front of the differential mounted very solidly in the frame.  There is thousands of ft-lbs of torque trying to lift the diff&#039;s nose when you accelerate in lower gears, and the miata has the PPF to handle that force.. in a locost, you need to improvise.

		<description>Hey, nice work man. I started a similar build with 4 other guys last October. Took us forever to get a donor, but we scored a totalled 97 miata with about 60K miles on it for $850. No supercharger tough... It was in an accident. Any tips on how to modify the frame for the rear diff?
Where are you located? I&#039;m in Boston.
